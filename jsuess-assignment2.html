<!--You will be building a interactive web page in order to learn to use Git, and also practice your HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.
 After forking the repository that contains the source for the assignment and lecture, you will start by copying the provided skeleton web page. 
 You must name this copy as "mix_user_name-assignment2.html", and check it into the repository before making any changes. If you add any CSS or Javascript
 (hint: you will at least need Javascript), please make a separate file for new code. I will walk you through this below. The filenames for any javascript
 and css must also contain your mix user name, but can otherwise be named as you wish. You may still use the existing files as well, but you should not
 modify them. You'll need to include any new files as appropriate in the <head> section. This assignment will be submitted via github as a pull request.

Your web page must have a form can collect any type of information, but it must meet these requirements:
The form must submit at least 4 different variables, using 4 different types of input (not necessarily <input> tags).
At least 3 of the form variables must be required via Javascript validation.
One variable must be validated for something besides existance (for example, a number that has to be within a certain range).
Your action should be "http://symlink.dk/code/php/submit" and your method should be POST so I can easily verify you have correctly submitted the form.
Your page should have at least one animation that can be activated with a button.
You must manipulate the DOM. You can do this via a button, by showing an error message in a div, or however you would like to activate it. Just make it clear so I don't miss it.

You may use any of the code provided, and the skeleton includes jquery, script.js, and style.css. If you are able to figure out how to use it, you are 
allowed to use the JQuery Validation Plugin(http://jqueryvalidation.org/) to perform your form validation.-->
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />
  <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<!-- there should not be anything between your </head> and <body> -->
<!-- Ideally, you would track the validity of the form with a variable
     and accumulate all the error messages together, so the user
     doesn't have to submit the form repeatedly.  Also, inserting
     HTML into the page is usually preferable to using alert() -->
<script>
function validation()
	{
		var x = document.forms["form1"]["handle"].value
		if (x=='')
			{		
			alert('You must supply a name');
			return false;
			}
		var x = document.forms["form1"]["age"].value
		if (x < 18)
			{
			alert('You must be 18');
			return false;
			}
		var x = $('input[name=affiliation]:checked').length >0
		if (x == false)
			{
			alert('Please select an affiliation.');
			return false;
			}
		var x = $('input[name=elections]:checked').length >0
		if (x == false)
			{
			alert('Please select prior elections.  If you have not voted before select "Have not voted"');
			return false;
			}
