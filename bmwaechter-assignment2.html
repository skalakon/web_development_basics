       doesn't have to submit the form repeatedly.  Also, inserting

	<!-- see above about needing a / at the end of the action -->
    Also a quick note... i set the method of my form to be 'get' rather than 'post' as you requested. This is because when it was set to post, the submission did not recognize any of the inputs submitted, i do not know why this is.
